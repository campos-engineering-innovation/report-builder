##Report Builder Master Copy and File Structure  
###Latest Version: 7.12.5
  
The .gitkeep files are there to ensure the folder structure is kept intact, as blank folders do not get tracked correctly.  
They should not affect the function of the program.  

`clear.exe` is a script to delete the files that are generated from the Report Builder to speed up testing.  
Make sure `clear_config.json` is in the current directory
It can be run by double clicking on the `clear.exe` program  
If any errors are encountered while running the script, rename your current working directory to `report-builder`, `sound-builder` or talk to Joseph/Dirk  
ONLY EVER RUN THIS SCRIPT IN ITS OWN DIRECTORY, DO NOT RUN THIS ANYWHERE ELSE AS IT MAY DELETE UNRELATED FOLDERS
