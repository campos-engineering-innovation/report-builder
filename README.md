This is the master copy of the Report Builder File and Folders.  
The .gitkeep files are there to ensure the folder structure is kept intact, as blank folders do not get tracked correctly.  
They should not affect the function of the program.  

clear.py is a script to delete the files that are generated from the Report Builder to speed up testing.  
It can be run in the terminal with  
`python .\clear.py`
